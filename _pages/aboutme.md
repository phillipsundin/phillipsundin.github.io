I am a Biostatistics graduate student at UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health. My primary research interests include the design of experiments, cluster-randomized trials, longitudinal analyses, survival analyses, and multi-state models. I have several co-authorships on papers on mental health, global health, and public health interventions. I am also very interested in clinical trial design and methodology.

Before joining UCLA, I was a strategy consultant in Deloitte's Strategy and Operations division. I completed my M.S. in Biostatistics at UCLA in 2018. For my undergraduate degree, I graduated from Pennsylvania State University in 2014 with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering and honors from the Schreyer Honors College.
